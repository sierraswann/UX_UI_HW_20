           <h2>The Solution:</h2>To make female traveling experiences more enjoyable, we intend to develop an app that will offer women<br>real-time emergency assistance. The app will also alert them to local, female-owned establishments and offer a chat room<br>for connections in country.

              <p>From our research, we were able to obtain 23 survey results from women around the world and interviewed 5 women who travel frequently and have even lived as expats in foreign countries. We had 2 weeks to research, quantify, and design this app.  
              </p>
              <p>Tasked with finding a way to make traveling easier, I instantly thought of making an app for women. I was interested in knowing these 4 things about female travelers:</p>
