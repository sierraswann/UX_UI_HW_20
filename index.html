           <h2>The Solution:</h2>To make female traveling experiences more enjoyable, we intend to develop an app that will offer women<br>real-time emergency assistance. The app will also alert them to local, female-owned establishments and offer a chat room<br>for connections in country.

              <h1>Research</h1>
                <p>My partner and I started this project together and created a Proto-Persona named Penelope Roberts. Penelope is 28 years old and works as a Remote Film Editor. This allows her to fuel her love of travel. 
                </p>
                <p>From our research, we were able to obtain 23 survey results from women around the world and interviewed 5 women who travel frequently and have even lived as expats in foreign countries. We had 2 weeks to research, quantify, and design this app.  
                </p>
                <p>Tasked with finding a way to make traveling easier, I instantly thought of making an app for women. I was interested in knowing these 4 things about female travelers:</p>

                    <li>what resources they used to find places to stay while traveling</li>
                    <li>what they like to do when they travel</li>
                    <li>what do they take into consideration when they are planning their trips</li>

                  <p>My partner and I performed a competitor analysis of a few different apps and websites. Overall, the idea seemed to be done before, but it was up to us to give our app its own unique flavor.
