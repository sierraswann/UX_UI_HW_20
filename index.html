              <h1>Research</h1>
                <p>My partner and I started this project together and created a Proto-Persona named Penelope Roberts. Penelope is 28 years old and works as a Remote Film Editor. This allows her to fuel her love of travel. 
                </p>
                <p>From our research, we were able to obtain 23 survey results from women around the world and interviewed 5 women who travel frequently and have even lived as expats in foreign countries. We had 2 weeks to research, quantify, and design this app.  
                </p>
                <p>Tasked with finding a way to make traveling easier, I instantly thought of making an app for women. I was interested in knowing these 4 things about female travelers:</p>

                    <li>what resources they used to find places to stay while traveling</li>
                    <li>what they like to do when they travel</li>
                    <li>what do they take into consideration when they are planning their trips</li>
                  </ul>

                <div class="last text-left">
                  <p>My partner and I performed a competitor analysis of a few different apps and websites. Overall, the idea seemed to be done before, but it was up to us to give our app its own unique flavor.

                <P>However, as my partner and I branched off I decided to make my version of the app a hosting website close to Airbnb, but<br>for women only. Looking at current successful models, I had to decide how I wanted to implement the safety aspect of the<br>app. I decided that users would need to create a profile and take a selfie in order to prove their identity before they were<br>able to be fully integrated into the community. Users with unapproved profiles would still have access to seeing the hosts,<br>but would not be able to message people or participate in chats until their profile was verified. Although this seems<br>intrusive, I wanted the community to feel as safe as possible while creating a space for women to share their experiences<br>and homes. The idea is for users to create organic relationships through this app.
